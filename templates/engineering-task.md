## Risk tier

## Requirements

## Acceptance criteria

## Assumptions and uncertainty

## Security invariants

## Read-only baseline

## Alternatives and trade-offs

## Selected design

## Affected files

## Pre-change backup

## Rollback or recovery

## Risk analysis

For Tier 2 and Tier 3, record status, summary, evidence path, and explicit assessments of consequence, reversibility, data sensitivity, operational reach, physical effects, affected-party impact, and AI or socio-technical risk.

## Deterministic control boundaries

For Tier 2 and Tier 3, record externally enforced filesystem-write, command-execution, network-egress, dependency-source, secret-access, and approval boundaries, denial tests, and post-change verification. Unknown or prompt-only state blocks.

## Exact artifact identity

Record the configuration version, canonical path, identity method, reviewed identifier, tested identifier, execution identifier, handoff identifier, common-match result, provenance, evidence-freshness status/basis/time, and evidence path.

## Change traceability

Link each requirement to the changed artifact, tests, and evidence. Record the orphan count; Tier 2 and Tier 3 require zero.

## Data governance

Record applicability, purpose, owner, classes, minimum-necessary fields, provenance, authority, retention, deletion or archival conditions, access boundary, and any separately authorized repurposing. If not applicable, record `NOT_APPLICABLE` and a reason.

## Current threat model

Record applicability, threats, mitigations, evidence, and confirmation that review occurred after the last material change. If not applicable, record `NOT_APPLICABLE` and a reason.

## Consequential AI assurance

Record applicability, intended and unsupported uses, affected stakeholders, provenance, foreseeable misuse, operating bounds, and measurable quality, safety, security, and fairness criteria. Each criterion records a measure, threshold, and evidence path. Also record Taylor's human decision paths, representative/adversarial/handoff tests, monitoring and reassessment, limitations, and retirement. If not applicable, record `NOT_APPLICABLE` and a reason.

## Monitoring and safe degradation

Record applicability, owner, expected operating range, alert thresholds, stop thresholds, reassessment triggers, safe degradation, and evidence. If not applicable, record `NOT_APPLICABLE` and a reason.

## Hazard analysis and residual risk

For Tier 3, list hazards, elimination or mitigation controls, passing test evidence, and a cross-domain check. Any accepted residual risk requires separate Taylor `HUMAN` and `OUT_OF_BAND` acceptance evidence.

## Tests

Every required passing test record must include `status: PASS` and a nonblank `evidence_path`.

## Verification

- Verification status (`PASS` or `VERIFIED` for Tier 2 and Tier 3):

## Validation

- Validation status (`PASS` or `VERIFIED` for Tier 2 and Tier 3):

## Independent review or audit

- Task author:
- Reviewer:
- Reviewer role:
- Open-issues status:
- Retest status:
- Evidence path:

## Taylor approval

- Status:
- Approver:
- Approver role (`HUMAN` or `AGENT`):
- Approval mode (`OUT_OF_BAND` or `IN_BAND`):
- Evidence path:
- Separate interactive human confirmation outside the evaluating agent:

For Tier 3, the gate requires `APPROVED`, `Taylor`, `HUMAN`, `OUT_OF_BAND`, and a non-empty evidence path. This record does not cryptographically authenticate Taylor or independently prove human identity, and the gate never executes the task.
